\subsection*{1 - Exam preparation}

We consider the following problem :
\begin{problem}
    Taking the right set of courses for each semester is always challenging – in this problem you will design an algorithm for this task. \\
    Suppose that there are $n$ courses available for the next semester and the exam season for the next semester starts at day $1$. Also, for any $j \in {1, 2, . . . , n}$, the $j$’th course has $c_j$ credits and its exam is on day $d_j$. In order to pass a course you need to allocate exactly one day to prepare for its exam. You want to obtain the maximum number of credits possible in the next semester. Design an efficient algorithm that finds a set of optimal courses (with the maximum credits in total) that you can pass and prove the correctness of your algorithm, assuming the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can only prepare for the exams after the exam season starts (it starts on day 1).
        \item On each day, you can only study one course the whole day (no multitasking).
        \item The exams take place at the end of each day. Assume that they do not take any time, i.e., if you have any number of exams on any day, you can still study on that day.
        \item If you do not study for a course before its exam, you are guaranteed to fail that course. For example, to pass an exam that is on day $d_j$, you need to study for that exam on a day $i$, where $1 \leq i \leq d_j$.
        \item It is possible to have more than one exam on a day.
    \end{itemize}

\end{problem}

\subsubsection*{Proposed Solution}

Consider the bipartite graph $G = (T \cup S, E)$ that we construct as such :
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each day of the session we add a vertex $t_i$ to $T$ (so $T = \left\lbrace t_1, t_2, ... t_m \right\rbrace)$ for a $m$ days long session.
    \item For each possible course we add a vertex $s_i$ to $S$ (so $S = \left\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_n \right\rbrace)$ for a semester where $n$ courses are available.
    \item We add an edge $e=(t_j,s_i)$ between two vertices $\iff i \leq d_j$ (for a given course-vertex $s_i$ we add an edge to every day-vertex $t_j$ when it would still be possible to prepare for the exam).
\end{itemize}
We then define the following cost function $w : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
\[ w_{(t_j,s_i)} = c_j. \]
The problem as formulated becomes a \textit{maximum-weight bipartite matching} problem on $G$ with respect to $w$ that we can solve in polynomial time (as it is a matroid intersection problem).
